			<b>SINCE DEMOCRACY</b> is back in the country, <srong>the General Workers’ Union (UGT, in its Spanish acronym) has only had two general secretaries: Nicolás Redondo and Cándido Méndez</srong>, who has just announced that he will not be a candidate for re-election. <strong>Comisiones Obreras</strong> (the largest union, known in Spanish as CCOO) <strong>has chosen four leaders since 1976</strong>: Marcelino Camacho, Antonio Gutiérrez, José María Fidalgo and Ignacio Fernández aka Toxo. <strong>All men</strong>, even if today women are more than 40% of total members in executive committees of both unions. Workers Union’s council only includes one woman in six members. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>FEMALE EXPERTS</b> who have analysed this phenomenon explain it as the result of a late incorporation of women to the workforce after Franco’s dictatorship, the instability of the jobs that are mainly occupied by women – which makes them invisible – and a low rate of female union membership, but also a male vision of both the work and the unions, among other reasons.

			<b>THE SITUATION</b> is not better in business associations: <strong>the powerful Confederación Española de Organizaciones Empresariales (CEOE) only includes seven women in its executive committee formed of 58 members (12%)</strong> and has never had a female leader. Apparently, they are not concerned about International Labour Organization’s recommendations for business lobbying groups, which include promoting more women in top positions.
